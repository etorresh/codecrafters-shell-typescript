This repository is my implementation of a POSIX-style shell written in TypeScript.

It was built as part of the CodeCrafters “Build Your Own Shell” challenge and supports running external programs along with built-in commands like ECHO, EXIT, TYPE.

The entry point is app/main.ts. To run the shell locally, install Bun and execute ./your_program.sh.
